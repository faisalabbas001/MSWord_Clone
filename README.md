MSWORD_CLONE

Using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, I developed a fully responsive MS Word-like application. This powerful tool enables users to:


✍️ Change Fonts
🖍 Adjust Text Alignments and Colors
🔠 Modify Font Sizes
🔡 Transform Text
🔢 Count Words and Letters




Key Features:
Font Customization: Select from various fonts to suit your document style.

Text Alignment & Colors: Easily adjust text alignment and color to highlight key information.

Font Size Control: Modify the size of your text for better readability.

Text Transformation: Convert text to uppercase, lowercase, and more.

Word & Letter Count: Keep track of your document's length with real-time word and letter count.
